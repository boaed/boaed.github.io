## About Me

Hi! I'm a PhD candidate in Mathematics, working on problems at the intersection of **Compressive Sensing** and **High-Dimensional Probability**. I’m especially interested in how randomness and structure can be used to extract meaningful information from limited or noisy data.

My research draws from probability, analysis, and optimization, with applications in signal processing, data science, and beyond. I’m currently based at [Michigan State University]([https://your-university.edu](https://math.msu.edu/)), where I’m advised by [Mark Iwen]([https://advisor-website.com](https://users.math.msu.edu/users/iwenmark/)).

I’m always up for a good math discussion—feel free to check out my work or get in touch!
